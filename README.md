# Hardware-A-Blending-Application
### Presented By: Julian-Justin Djoum, Lorenzo Gabree, Orlando Salas, Danny Silvestre Suarez, & Vashisht Panday

   The solution to our “Hardware ‘A Blending’ Application” project is going to involve designing hardware within an FPGA that will use an image alpha blending algorithm coded in MATLAB to merge two images based on a specific blending ratio.
